## Job Description

Our data science team is highly innovative. We partner with some of the best universities in the world, and for us, innovation matters.

As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, you will be working in a cross-functional, highly diverse platform and will be creating new and improving internal and external facing data products.

You will be driving the implementation and scale-up of algorithms for measurable impact across the business. You will set up and conduct large-scale experiments to test hypotheses and drive product development.

You will be keeping up to date with relevant state-of-the-art research, taking part in reading groups alongside other scientists, with the opportunity to publish novel prototypes for the business at top conferences.

You will be continually developing and improving our code and technology, taking an active role in the conception of brand-new features for our millions of global customers. You will take part in regular Tech Develops days to learn new things, take part in internal and external hackathons, and share your knowledge and help drive improvements in engineering.

You will be mentoring and coaching junior members of the team, supporting their technical progress.

At ASOS, as an online only retailer, we have unique datasets, transactions and click streams for millions of customers and photos, videos, and text descriptions of hundreds of thousands of products
