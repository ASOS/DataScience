## Job Description

As a Lead Machine Learning Scientist for Search & Recommender systems, you partner with Product Management and with key stakeholders, to identify opportunities and define the scientific direction for our recommendations and search ranking algorithms. You have strong commercial acumen as well as a passion for scientific research. This is a hands-on role as well as a leadership role.

You lead across multiple cross-functional teams which are focussed on using machine learning to personalise product discovery across our website and mobile apps, with the goal of improving the customer experience and increasing revenue and profit for the business. We passionately believe that cross-functional working is the key to any successful ML production system. The whole team is responsible for the end-to-end system, and we are all accountable for making sure it performs in production, at the scale at which ASOS operates.

Your team will be setting up and conducting large-scale experiments to test hypotheses and drive product development, and you will be expected to both conduct these yourself, as well as mentor those in your team conducting these. As a lead, you will need to keep up to date with relevant state-of-the-art research, taking part and leading reading groups alongside other scientists, with the opportunity to publish novel prototypes for the business at top research conferences.

At ASOS, as an online only retailer, we have unique datasets -transactions and click streams for millions of customers and photos, videos, and text descriptions of hundreds of thousands of products.

### Qualifications

#### About You

* You are a highly experienced Machine Learning Scientist, with extensive experience in Recommender and Search ranking systems that personalise the experience for customers. You have deep expertise in Deep Learning, and in machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. You have a strong engineering mindset and good knowledge of software engineering principles, agile methodologies, data engineering, distributed systems and machine learning at scale.

* You have a broad and deep understanding of machine learning theory and data science. You are adept at exploring and defining the problem space and building ML models, choosing the appropriate ML technique for the problem, and defining well thought-out pragmatic solutions.

* You thrive in supporting a cross-functional team, including scientists, engineers, and non-technical stakeholders. You are approachable, collaborative and you actively nurture a diverse and inclusive workplace. You have excellent leadership and interpersonal skills, and love to mentor across your teams in an open, respectful, flexible, empathic manner and you foster a culture of feedback. You are confident working and collaborating with other scientists, as well as understanding how to partner on research and solve complex problems.

* You are an individual that is experienced working in a cloud native python software stack and enjoys building production ready ML applications. You have experience working with data from multiple sources, involving complex/high-dimensional data (e.g. image, clickstreams, text, video, speech, time series). You’ll be able to support a team through the machine learning development lifecycle, establishing excellent engineering and ML Ops practices, and delivering impact through online experimentation.

* You actively innovate, nurture & encourage innovation within your team and you are not afraid to take calculated risks to deliver maximum impact. You have effective communication skills and can facilitate discussions across teams and with business stakeholders. You excel at explaining complex data science concepts to non-technical audiences.

* You will have a proven track record of delivering recommender/search ranking products that impact business performance. You get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
