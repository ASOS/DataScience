## Job Description

ASOS is one of the UK’s top fashion and beauty destinations, expanding globally at a rapid pace. Our values are to be authentic, brave and creative, and we live and breathe these in everything we do.

Digital Experience at ASOS is all about finding new ways to improve our customers’ shopping experiences. Thinking about what our customers really want from their shopping experience keeps the User Experience team awake at night (well, busy in the day!). Their job is to create the most usable and engaging experience possible. Our digital analytics team spend their days understanding where our users come from and what they do when they’re on the site. We want to know how they find us, the devices they use, how they interact with the site, and how successful we are at converting them into customers.

## About the Role

As a machine learning scientist, you will be part of a cross-functional team focused on our digital experience (such as personalisation, search or ranking). We passionately believe that cross-functional working is the key to any successful machine learning production system. The whole team is responsible for the end-to-end system, and we are all accountable for making sure it performs in production.

You will be focused on framing digital experience problems as machine learning problems using multiple rich sources (image, text) and large volume sources (clickstream). You will help build models using deep learning frameworks that can be served at scale using large volumes of data and big data technologies.

You will participate in conducting large-scale experiments to test hypotheses and drive product development. You will keep up to date with relevant state-of-the-art research by attending and publishing at top conferences as well as taking part and leading reading groups alongside other scientists,

At ASOS, as an online only retailer, we have unique datasets -transactions and click streams for millions of customers and photos, videos, and text descriptions of hundreds of thousands of products.

## Qualifications
### About You

* You have a background in Machine Learning and previous experience applying state of the art deep learning and machine learning methods to solve complex problems either in academia or industry.
* You have a broad understanding of machine learning theory and in-depth knowledge of deep learning. You are comfortable exploring and defining the problem and choosing the appropriate machine learning technique to solve it.
* You thrive in cross-functional teams, including scientists, engineers, and non-technical stakeholders. You are approachable, collaborative and you actively nurture a diverse and inclusive workplace.
* You are comfortable working in Python software stacks and familiar with at least one deep learning frameworks (such as TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch) and enjoy going from ideas and prototypes into products and applications. You have experience working with data from multiple sources, involving complex/high — dimensional data (e.g. image, clickstreams, text, video, speech, time series).
* We would love to meet someone who has authored publications in top-tier machine learning conferences or journals (such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, KDD, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ACL, EMNLP) and want to keep up to date with the state of the art.
* You like to learn from others as well as mentor. You enjoy working and collaborating with other scientists to solve complex problems. You actively innovate, encouraging innovation within your team and you are not afraid to take risks to deliver maximum impact. You have effective communication skills and can facilitate discussions across teams and with business stakeholders. You are excellent at explaining complex data science concepts to non-technical audiences.
